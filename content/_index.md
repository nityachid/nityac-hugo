# About Me

I solve the messy operational challenges that come with growth.  
For the past 12 years, I’ve worked with teams at Amazon, Practo, and ShopBack to scale fast without falling apart. I’ve learned when to build, when to duct-tape, and when to say no.  
I move fast. I learn faster. I care about ROI, not activity.  
Right now, I’m focused on using AI and automation to take the repetitive stuff off people’s plates so they can do real, strategic work.  
My process starts with first principles. I look at what worked, what broke, and why. Then I rebuild systems that can grow without the chaos.  
I like sitting at the crossroads of ops, product, and business—the place where the hardest problems usually live.  
If that’s your world too, we’ll probably have a lot to talk about.
