# About Me

<div class="about-richtext">

<p><strong>I solve the messy operational challenges that come with growth.</strong></p>

<p>Over the past 12 years, I’ve helped teams at <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.practo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Practo</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopback.sg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ShopBack</a> scale fast without falling apart. I’ve learned when to build, when to duct-tape, and when to say no.</p>

<p>I move fast. I learn faster. I care about ROI, not activity.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been obsessed with using AI and automation to take the repetitive stuff off people’s plates—so they can focus on real, strategic work.</p>

<p>My process always starts with first principles. What worked? What broke? Why? Then I rebuild systems that can grow without the chaos.</p>

<p>I sit at the crossroads of ops, product, and business—the place where the hardest (and most interesting) problems usually live.</p>

<p>If that’s your world too, we’ll probably have a lot to talk about.</p>
