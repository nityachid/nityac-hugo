# About

### What I Do
I help teams fix the messy operational challenges that come with growth.  
When business complexity outgrows the tools and processes in place, I help rebuild them faster, leaner, smarter.

### The Journey
For the past 12 years, I’ve led operations and growth across [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com), [Practo](https://www.practo.com), and [ShopBack](https://www.shopback.sg), scaling teams and systems in 13 countries.  
I’ve seen what happens when companies outgrow their structure and how the right mix of process, product, and people turns chaos into momentum.

### What I’ve Learnt
I move fast. I learn faster. I care about ROI, not activity.  
Speed without clarity burns out teams — and great systems make good people even better.

### What I’m Building
I’ve spent years helping teams scale without breaking their systems. Now I’m applying the same lens to how AI is reshaping commerce.  
I’m also exploring how brands can stay visible and understood inside AI-driven answers — and what it takes to build trust when algorithms are the new gatekeepers.

### How I Think
I start from first principles.  
What worked? What broke? Why?  
Then I rebuild systems that can scale without falling apart.

### Where I Sit
Somewhere between operations, product, and business strategy.  
It’s the messy middle, and it’s my favorite place to be.  
If that’s your world too, we’ll probably have a lot to talk about.
